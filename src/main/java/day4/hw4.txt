4.1 What is type erasure? <T extends E>?
	To implement generics, the Java compiler applies type erasure to:
        -	Replace all type parameters in generic types with their bounds (<T extends E>) or object type if the type parameters are unbounded. The produced bytecode contains only ordinary classes, interfaces and methods.
        -	Insert type casts if necessary to preserve type safety.
        -	Generate bridge methods to preserve polymorphism in extended generic types.
    Type erasure ensures that no new classes are created for parameterized types; consequently, generics incur no runtime overhead.

4.2 Java 8 new features â€“ Method reference
	Method reference is used to refer method of functional interface. When using lambda expression to refer a method, method reference can be used instead.
	Three ways to refer a method:
        1.	Reference to a Static method: ClassName::MethodName
        2.	Reference to a Instance method: ObjectName::MethodName
        3.	Reference to a Constructor: ClassName::new
